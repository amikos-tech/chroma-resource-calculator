# Chroma Resource Calculator

A simple resource calculator that helps users to estimate the resources required to run Chroma.


## Roadmap

- Cloud vendor machine types - provide an estimate of the machine types required at different cloud vendors to run Chroma.
- More intuitive estimates by focusing on the user's data e.g. number of documents, size of documents, etc.
- Model registry - additional model information
- Make available at `calculator.chromadb.dev` via S3 deployment
